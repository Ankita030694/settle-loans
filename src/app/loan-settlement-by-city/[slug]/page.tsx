// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is loan settlement and how does it work?",
    answer: "Loan settlement, also known as debt settlement, is a legal financial process where a borrower negotiates with the lender to pay a lump sum amount that is lower than the total outstanding debt to close the loan account. This is typically done through a One Time Settlement (OTS) scheme under RBI guidelines. The bank agrees to waive a portion of the interest and penalties in exchange for a one-time payment."
  },
  {
    question: "Is loan settlement legal in India?",
    answer: "Yes, loan settlement is completely legal in India. It is governed by guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and is a standard banking practice for recovering non-performing assets (NPAs). Banks and NBFCs prefer settlement over long-drawn legal battles when they are convinced of the borrower's genuine inability to pay. Having a qualified lawyer ensures the process is handled correctly."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I save through loan settlement?",
    answer: "The amount you can save depends on various factors including the type of loan, the age of the default, your current financial status, and the bank's policies. Typically, borrowers can save anywhere from 30% to 50% of the total outstanding amount. In some cases involving older defaults or high accumulated interest, savings can be even higher."
  },
  {
    question: "Will loan settlement affect my CIBIL score?",
    answer: "Yes, opting for a loan settlement will have an impact on your CIBIL score. When a loan is settled instead of being paid in full, the account status is reported as 'Settled' rather than 'Closed' to credit bureaus. This can drop your score by 50-100 points. However, this is often a better alternative to a 'Written Off' status or continuing default. Once your finances stabilize, you can rebuild your score over 12-24 months."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the settlement process take?",
    answer: "The timeline for loan settlement varies from case to case. On average, the loan settlement process takes between 3 to 6 months to reach a final agreement. This duration allows for multiple rounds of negotiation, verification of financial documents, and internal approvals from the bank's credit committee."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I settle credit card debt?",
    answer: "Yes, credit card debt settlement is one of the most common types of debt settled in India. Due to the unsecured nature of credit cards and the exorbitant interest rates (often 30-40% per annum), banks are often willing to settle for a reasonable principal amount rather than write off the entire debt."
  },
  {
    question: "What documents are required for loan settlement?",
    answer: "To initiate a loan settlement, you generally need KYC documents (Aadhar, PAN), loan account statements, salary slips or income proof, bank statements (last 6 months), termination letters (if unemployed), medical records (if applicable), and any correspondence with the bank."
  },
  {
    question: "Can banks harass me during the settlement process?",
    answer: "Harassment by recovery agents is illegal under RBI guidelines and Supreme Court judgments. Once you engage a legal firm like SettleLoans, we formally notify the bank of your representation. This typically stops direct harassment as all communication must then be routed through your legal counsel."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a One Time Settlement (OTS) scheme?",
    answer: "A One Time Settlement (OTS) is a scheme offered by banks to recover dues from borrowers who have defaulted. Under an OTS, the borrower agrees to pay a specific negotiated amount in a single payment (or a few installments) to close the loan account. This amount is usually less than the total outstanding dues."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get a loan after settlement?",
    answer: "Getting a new loan immediately after a settlement can be difficult due to the negative impact on your credit score. However, this is not a permanent ban. By practicing good financial habits, such as paying other bills on time and using secured credit cards, you can improve your score. Typically, after 2-3 years of good credit behavior, you become eligible for new loans again."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the role of a lawyer in loan settlement?",
    answer: "A loan settlement lawyer plays a critical role in protecting your rights during the settlement process. They handle all communications with the bank, preventing harassment and ensuring you are not coerced into unfair terms. Lawyers understand the legal nuances of the SARFAESI Act, DRT proceedings, and RBI guidelines."
  },
  {
    question: "Is settlement better than bankruptcy?",
    answer: "For most individuals in India, loan settlement is a far better option than filing for bankruptcy or insolvency. Bankruptcy is a long, complex legal process that severely damages your financial reputation. Settlement offers a dignified exit route that resolves the debt specifically without the sweeping legal incapacities associated with bankruptcy."

                    Loan settlement, often referred to as a <strong>One Time Settlement (OTS) scheme</strong>, is a process utilized when a borrower is unable to service their debt obligations due to verifiable financial hardship. Unlike a standard loan closure where you pay back every rupee of the principal and interest, a settlement involves the lender agreeing to accept a lower amount to close the account.

                    Banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are business entities. When a loan turns into a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), it costs them money to maintain it on their books and pursue legal recovery. If they are convinced that a borrower in {locationName} genuinely cannot pay the full amount, they often prefer to recover a portion of the money immediately rather than spending years in litigation with uncertain results.

                    Transparency is one of our core values. We want borrowers in {locationName} to make an informed decision. It is true that <strong>loan settlement negatively impacts your credit score</strong>. When you settle a loan, the bank reports the status as &quot;Settled&quot; to credit bureaus like CIBIL, Experian, and Equifax.

                    This &quot;Settled&quot; tag can lower your score by 50 to 100 points. However, you must weigh this against the alternative. A &quot;Default&quot; or &quot;Written Off&quot; status is far more damaging.
